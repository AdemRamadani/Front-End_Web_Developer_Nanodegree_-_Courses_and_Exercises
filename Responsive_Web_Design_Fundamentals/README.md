# Responsive Web Design Fundamentals

## Project Part 1

### Building The Home Town app, part 1 of 3

1) Add a <meta> viewport to the page with initial scale set.

2) Adjust CSS and markup so that everything displays in a single column. Use relative widths so that the things stretch to fit across any viewport width.

3) Make sure your touch targets are easy to hit.

4) Test your site across different viewports. Try it on different phones tablets, and desktops!

## Project Part 2
